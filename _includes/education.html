            I've taken quite an interest in Computer Science over the past year,
            so I've decided to take up studying it.  I have a pretty strong interest
            in Machine Learning and Quantum Computing, so I'm excited to see where that goes.
            My plan is to continue into a Master's program where I can specialize in one of those
            fields. X22
